Use the Makefile provided in the root directory:

make [release|debug|clean] [MAC=1] [IFORT=1] [ICC=1] [MKL=1] [MKL_PATH=/opt/...] 
     [EM64T=1] [ILP64=1] [CVM_FLOAT=1] [ICCT=1] [STATIC_ONLY=1] [IFORT_PATH=/opt/...]

Here
    - release|debug is a target (by default it builds both), use "clean" to clean all 
    - MAC=1 should be set to build the library on Mac OS.
    - IFORT=1 instructs to use Intel Fortran compiler (gfortran is the default).
    - ICC=1 instructs to use Intel C++ compiler (g++ is the default)
    - MKL=1 instructs to use Intel MKL library (it uses native BLAS and LAPACK
      libraries by default)
    - MKL_PATH=path specifies the directory where the MKL is installed to. It's
      set to "/opt/intel/composerxe/mkl/lib" by default.
    - EM64T=1 instructs to build EM64T version of the library. 
    - ILP64=1 instructs to build INT64-based version of the library (EM64T must be turned on).
    - CVM_FLOAT=1 [deprecated] instructs to build float version of the library.
    - ICCT=1 instructs to use Intel C++ compiler for building the regression 
      test utility (g++ is the default).
    - STATIC_ONLY=1 instructs to build .a files only. Both .so and .a will be built otherwise.
    - IFORT_PATH=path specifies the directory where the Intel Fortran is installed to. 
      It's set to "/opt/intel/composerxe/bin" by default.
